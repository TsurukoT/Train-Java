# Project Title

> The police know what day it happened on, but they are not quite sure when it 
happened. Additionally, they arenâ€™t quite sure they have correct statements from everyone. You and your professor have 
been asked to help the police by recreating the events on the day leading up to the murder. You will base your simulation 
of notes from the two detectives working on the case: Fox and Alleyn

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Run 'javac *.java
3. Run java PA2 ./scenario2/trains-scenario2.txt ./scenario2/people-scenario2.txt C6 06:15
# asks for suspects for a murder on car "C6" at 6:15. So the simulator stops at this point and tries to find suspects.
